#Code Book

The project consisted on cleaning and processing data. The data used can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Data:
features - features.txt, 561 rows x 2 cols
activities - activity_labels.txt : 6 rows x 2 cols
List of activities performed when the measurements were made and its codes 
subject_test - test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows x 1 col
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows x 561 cols
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows x 1 col
contains test data of activities'code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows x 1 col
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows x 561 cols
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows x 1 col
contains train data of activities'code labels

xtot (10299 rows x 561 cols) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
ytot (10299 rows x 1 col) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subjecttot (10299 rows x 1 cols) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
mergeddata (10299 rows x 563 cols) is created by merging subjecttot, ytot and xtot using cbind() function

TidyData (10299 rows x 88 cols) is created by subsetting mergeddata, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

The numbers in the code column of TidyData were replaced with the corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column's name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column's name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column's name replaced by Body
All Mag in column's name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column's name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column's name replaced by Time

FinalData (180 rows x 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalData into tidydataset.txt file.
